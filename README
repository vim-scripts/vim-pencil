The pencil plugin aspires to make Vim as powerful a tool for writers as it is for coders by focusing narrowly on the handful of tweaks needed to smooth the path to writing prose.

Features of the pencil plugin:

* For editing files in text, markdown, textile, and other prose-oriented file types
* Agnostic on soft line wrap versus hard line breaks, supporting both
* Auto-detects wrap mode via modeline and sampling
* Adjusts navigation key mappings to suit the wrap mode
* Creates undo points on common punctuation
* When using hard line breaks, enables autoformat while inserting text
* Buffer-scoped configuration (leaves your global settings alone)
